                    GRID 224p

This grid uses a 320x224 pattern in a 240p signal,
it is intended to mock-up the typical display area 
for other consoles, such as the SNES, Sega Genesis 
and Playstation.

You can use it to verify that all the visible area
is being displayed, and that there is no distortion
present. Consumer TVs may not show the red squares.

You can press #GA#G to toggle the starting scanline.
The current modes simulate the Genesis and SNES.
