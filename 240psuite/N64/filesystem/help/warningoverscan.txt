The #CNintendo 64#C system can not display the full
320x240 information drawn into the frame buffer.

As a result, several pixels are never shown on
screen. This is completely normal, and official
games have this same behaviour.

#YAs such it is recommended you don't use these
tests for multi console setups, but they work
perfectly fine for Nintendo 64.#Y
