                WHITE SCREEN (1/2)

This pattern can be changed between white, black,
red, green, blue and custom color full screens by 
using the #GR#G and #GL#G buttons.

Pressing #GA#G while displaying the black screen and 
in NTSC modes will toggle between 7.5 IRE and the 
0 IRE below black levels. 

Pressing #GA#G while displaying the white screen will
enter color edit mode, to select the RGB color to
fill the screen with. Use the d-pad, #GCL#G and #GCR#G
buttons to change each color.

                WHITE SCREEN (2/2)

Some displays and scalers have issues when
changing between a black 0 IRE and a white screen.

This pattern can also be used to check color 
purity, and for dead pixels in some displays.
