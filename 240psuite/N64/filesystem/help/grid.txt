                    GRID (1/3)

This grid uses a 320x240 pattern, and should fill
all of the 4:3 visible area. 

You can use it to verify that all the visible area
is being displayed, and that there is no distortion
present. Consumer TVs may not show the red squares.

A 640x480 Grid can be shown in compatible NTSC
video modes. 

In PAL resolutions, there are also two different 
grids. 

                                    #C(cont...)#C
                    GRID (2/3)

In the 288p PAL video, only 264 are visible lines.
Since 264 is not an exact multiple of 16, there is
a centered line of smaller blue rectangles. 

In 576i unscaled 1:1 mode, a full 640x528 grid is
shown. You can also use the 576i stretched option 
to fill the whole screen at the cost of 1:1 pixel 
mapping.

The 240 test suite draws from line 22 onwards from 
the blanking interval of NTSC signals, and line 23
for PAL. You can adjust this value for PAL in 1:1
mapping modes.
                                    #C(cont...)#C
                    GRID (3/3)

The d-pad can be used to move the grid around the
video signal. $A button resets it to its position.
