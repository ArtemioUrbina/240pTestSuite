                 COLORBARS (1/2)

This pattern allows you to calibrate each color:
Red, Green and Blue; as  well as the white level.

The default pattern shows 32 shades of each color,
but this platform is capable of 256. You can view
the last 32 and the first ones by pressing left 
or right. An extra pattern is also availabe with a 
white grid as background, for contrast balance.

This is adjusted in the same way black levels
are set with the #GPLUGE#G. If you adjusted the black
level correctly with the PLUGE, the rectangles 
under the #G1#G column should be barely visible.

                 COLORBARS (2/2)

Adjust the white level first, this is done using
the #YContrast#Y control on your TV set. Raise it
until you cannot distinguish between the two
blocks under #GF#G, and lower it slowly until you
can clearly tell them apart.  

The same procedure should be used with each
color, raise the control that adjusts the
individual color level (not the #Ycolor#Y/#Ytint#Y one)
until you can't tell the rightmost box under #GF#G
from the one to its left, and then lower it until
you can distinguish them clearly. 

Repeat for each color and you are set.
