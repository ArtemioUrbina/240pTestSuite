                  CHECKERBOARD

This pattern shows all the visible pixels in an
alternating white and black grid array.

You can toggle the pattern with SELECT, or turn
on auto-toggle each frame with the I button.

When auto-toggle is set, you should see it
alternating rapidly. On some setups, the pattern
doesn't change at all. This means that the signal
is being treated as 480i/576i and odd or even 
frames are being discarded completely.

A frame counter can be displayed on screen by
pressing left on the d-pad.
