                    SCROLL TEST


This test shows either an horizontal background
from Sonic or a vertical one from Kiki Kaikai.

Speed can be varied with up & down on the
d-pad and scroll direction with left or right.
Button I stops the screen and SELECT toggles
between vertical and horizontal scroll.

This can be used to notice any drops in
framerate, or pixel width inconsistencies.
