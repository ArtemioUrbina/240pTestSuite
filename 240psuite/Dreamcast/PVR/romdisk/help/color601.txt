           COLOR BARS WITH GRAY SCALE

This pattern idea and layout borrows from the 
#YDigital Video Essentials#Y color adjust pattern.

It has a gray background as reference, and can 
be used with color filters in order to adjust 
color accuracy. If your TV set has a blue only
mode, you can also use that to correct color
balance.
