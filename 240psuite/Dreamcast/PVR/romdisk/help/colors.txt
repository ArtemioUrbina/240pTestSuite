                 COLORBARS (1/2)

This pattern allows you to calibrate each color:
Red, Green and Blue; as  well as the white level.

This is adjusted in the same way black levels
are set with the #GPLUGE#G. If you adjusted the black
level correctly with the PLUGE, the rectangles 
under the #G1#G column should be barely visible.

Adjust the white level first, this is done using
the #YContrast#Y control on your TV set. Raise it
until you cannot distinguish between the two
blocks under #GF#G, and lower it slowly until you
can clearly tell them apart.          
                                      #C(cont...)#C
                 COLORBARS (2/2)

The same procedure should be used with each
color, raise the control that adjusts the
individual color level (not the #Ycolor#Y/#Ytint#Y one)
until you can't tell the rightmost box under #GF#G
from the one to its left, and then lower it until
you can distinguish them clearly. 

Repeat for each color and you are set.

The same bars with a grid pattern is also available
with the #GA#G button.
