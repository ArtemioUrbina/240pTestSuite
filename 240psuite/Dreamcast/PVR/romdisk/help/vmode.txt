                VIDEO MODES (1/10)

The #GDC#G version of the 240p suite supports the 
following video modes:

#YNTSC compatible modes (60hz):#Y The first 21
lines of NTSC are reserved and cannot contain 
video material in broadcast standards, since 
line 21 usually has close caption (CC) data.
Console games typically respect this, since 
their target display were consumer TVs. It has
525 lines in interlaced mode, of which only 480
are visible, 240 in each field. The following
modes start at line 22 of every field when in 
an NTSC console; when using #Ycomposite video#Y
                                   #C(cont...)#C
                VIDEO MODES (2/10)

PAL consoles use #YPAL 60#Y, and start at line 23.

 #G240p:#G The progressive variant of NTSC 525i
    line video, it has 262 lines of which 240
    video lines are active. This format is 
    used in most SD game consoles, from the 
    #YAtari VCS#Y to the #YPS2#Y. The #GDC#G version
    of the suite displays a full 320x240p screen.

 #G480i scaled 240p assets (NTSC):#G This displays
    the 240p patterns in 480i mode. It uses the 
    480 visible lines, 240 in each field. The 
    whole content of the suite is linedoubled in 
    this mode.                     #C(cont...)#C
                VIDEO MODES (3/10)

 #G480i mixed 480p/240p assets (1:1/NTSC):#G In this
    mode the content of the suite is never line 
    doubled.

    As a result, most screens end up filling 1/4th
    of the display in 1:1 pixel mode. However, 
    there are several patterns in 480 resolution
    that fill the screen, such as the grid, scroll
    and overscan.

                VIDEO MODES (4/10)

#YPAL compatible modes (50hz):#Y These modes must
be enabled from the #YOptions#Y menu and are
only available in #YEuropean Flash ROM#Y #GDreamcasts#G;
other regions output a corrupt PAL signal.

The first 22 lines of PAL are reserved and cannot
contain video material in broadcast standards.
Console games typically respect this, since their
target display were consumer TVs. It has 625 lines
in interlaced mode, of which only 576 are visible, 
288 in each field. 


                                   #C(cont...)#C
                VIDEO MODES (5/10)

The #GDC#G cannot use the whole 288 lines as active
video, instead it can draw 264 lines in 288p mode
and only 480 lines when in 576i mode. In order to
help overcome this limitation, the 240p suite adds
several options for evaluation of PAL modes. 

The first and recommended one, is using the #GPAL 
starting line#G option. It allows the PAL active
video to start at either line 23 (Top), centered
in the signal, or at the bottom of the signal. 
This allows using the 264/480 patterns to verify
overscan, alignment, geometry, etc.

                VIDEO MODES (6/10)

The #GEnable PAL Background#G option fills the
whole screen with the selected color, enabling
visualization of the full 264 active video 
signal when the menu or pattern shown does not 
match in 288p mode. 

Please keep in mind that when using a #GDC#G with
#YEuropean Flash ROM#Y, all NTSC video when in
#Ycomposite#Y will be #YPAL 60#Y (#YNTSC 4.43#Y). This means
color encoding will be in PAL regardless of the
selected output video mode.


                                   #C(cont...)#C
                VIDEO MODES (7/10)

The following modes start at line 23 of every
field, as the PAL standard determines. 

 #G288p#G: The progressive variant of PAL 625i
    line video, it has 312 lines of which 288
    video lines are active. This format is 
    used in most SD game consoles. The #GDC#G version
    of the suite displays a 320x264p screen.

 #G576i scaled 240p assets (PAL):#G This displays
    the 240p patterns in 576i mode. It uses the 
    480 visible lines, 240 in each field. The 
    whole content of the suite is linedoubled in 
    this mode.                     #C(cont...)#C
                VIDEO MODES (8/10)

 #G576i 480/240p assets (1:1/PAL):#G This
    mode has an identical 576i PAL signal, and
    the content of the suite is never line 
    doubled.

    As a result, most screens end up filling 1/4th
    of the screen in 1:1 pixel mode. However, 
    there are several patterns in 480 resolution
    that fill the active video area, such as the
    grid, scroll and overscan.



                                   #C(cont...)#C
                VIDEO MODES (9/10)

#Y480p compatible modes (60hz):#Y These modes are
only available when a #YVGA Box#Y is present.

 #G480p scaled 240p assets & scanlines:#G  This 
    displays the 240p patterns in 480p. The whole
    content of the suite is linedoubled, and 
    scanline parameters can be modified from the 
    #GOptions#G menu, they can also be completely
    disabled if needed.    

 #G480p mixed 480p/240p assets (1:1):#G In this
    mode the content of the suite is never line 
    doubled.
                                   #C(cont...)#C
                VIDEO MODES (10/10)

    As a result, most screens end up filling 1/4th
    of the display in 1:1 (PAR) pixel mode.

    However, there are several patterns in 480
    resolution that fill the screen, such as the
    grid, scroll, linearity (1:1 PAR) and overscan.
