             MANUAL LAG TEST (1/3)

#RWARNING: This evaluation is dependent on reflexes
and/or rhythm more than anything.#R The visual and
audio cues are the more revealing aspects which 
the user should considers.

Of course the interactive factor can give an
experienced player the hang of the system when
testing via different connections.

This test show a changing pattern on the screen,
and given a visual and repetitive cue, play a beep
alternating speakers. This should show to some
degree the any lag while processing the signal.

             MANUAL LAG TEST (2/3)

As an added feature, the user can click the #GA#G
button when the sprite is aligned with the one on
the background, and the offset in frames from the
actual intersection will be shown on screen. This
can be repeated ten times and the software will
calculate the average. Whenever the button was
pressed before the actual intersection frame, the
result will be ignored (but still shown onscreen).

The #GX#G button can be used to change the direction
of the sprite from vertical to horizontal, or
display both at the same time.

             MANUAL LAG TEST (3/3)

The #GR#G trigger can be used to turn off the audio
cue. If a #YPurupuru#Y (Jump pack) is found, it will
be used as well, it can be activated with the
#GL#G trigger.

The interval of movement can be rythmic or random,
and this can be toggled with the #GY#G button.

Since a frame is around 16 ms (1000/60) in NTSC
and 20ms (1000/50) in PAL,  that value must be
considered the general error when using the
test results.
