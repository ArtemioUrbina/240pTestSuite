                    GRID (1/2)

This grid uses a 320x240 pattern, and should fill
all of the 4:3 visible area. 

You can use it to verify that all the visible area
is being displayed, and that there is no distortion
present.

A 640x480 Grid can be shown in compatible NTSC
video modes. 

In PAL resolutions, there are also two different 
grids. 

                                   #C(cont...)#C
                    GRID (2/2)

In the 288p PAL video, only 264 are visible lines.
Since 264 is not an exact multiple of 16, there is
a centered line of smaller blue rectangles. 

In 576i unscaled 1:1 mode, a full 640x528 grid is
shown. 

The 240 test suite draws from line 22 onwards from 
the blanking interval of NTSC signals, and line 25
for PAL. It uses the whole visible area in both.
