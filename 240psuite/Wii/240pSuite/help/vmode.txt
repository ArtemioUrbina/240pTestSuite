                VIDEO MODES

This pattern is designed to show if all lines are
visible in your setup, and how your video
processor is handling 240p video. 

You should see a pattern of lines, each one pixel
in height, starting with a white one at the top of
the screen. You can toggle the pattern with 
button $X, or turn on auto-toggle each frame with
the $A button.

When auto-toggle is set, you should see the lines
alternating rapidly. On some setups, the pattern
doesn't change at all. This means that the signal
                                         (cont...)
            HORIZONTAL STRIPES (2/2)

is being treated as 480i and odd or even frames 
are being discarded completely.

A frame counter can be displayed on screen by 
pressing button $Y.

You can also display vertical bars by pressing $R,
that pattern will help you evaluate if the signal
is not distorted horizontaly, since all lines 
should be one pixel wide.

This pattern is completely distorted when using
the 576i stretched mode.
