                  HELP (1/2)

The 240p Test Suite was designed with two goals
in mind:

1) Evaluate 240p signal processing on modern TV
sets and video processing equipment; and 

2) Provide calibration patterns generated on your
game console to help in properly calibrating the
display's black, white and color levels.

Help is available on some patterns by pressing the
$S button.

This version of the suite supports 240p, 480i and
480p video modes. However, 480p is only available
via component cables, you can enable it from the
options menu.
