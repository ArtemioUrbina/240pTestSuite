                  HELP (1/2)

The 240p Test Suite was designed with two goals
in mind:

1) Evaluate 240p signal processing on modern TV
sets and video processing equipment; and 

2) Provide calibration patterns generated on your
game console to help in properly calibrating the
display's black, white and color levels.

Help is available on some patterns by pressing the
$S button.

This version of the suite supports 240p, 288p, 
576i, 480i and 480p video modes. However, 480p is
only available via component cables. 

In 288p and 576i PAL modes, the system is capable
of drawing the whole visible signal, 264 and 528
lines respectively.

PAL and 480p modes must be enabled from the 
options menu.
