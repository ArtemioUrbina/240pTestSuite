This is a handy batch file, which uses dolLZ3 and
mkisofs to create a bootable homebrew disc.

Usage:
1. Move your dol file to the "homebrew_disc" folder and rename it to "my.dol".
2. It will then be relocated and copied to "disc\bootldr.dol".
3. Launch "make_dol_and_iso.bat".

OR (if your dol file already is relocated / "dollz'd")

1. Move your dol file to the "homebrew_disc\disc" folder and rename it to "bootldr.dol".
2. Make sure there is no "my.dol" in the "homebrew_disc" folder.
3. Launch "make_dol_and_iso.bat".

Have fun :)
