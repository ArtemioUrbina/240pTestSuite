              STRIPED SPRITE TEST

There are actually deinterlacers out there which
can display the drop shadows correctly and still
interpreted 240p as 480i. With a striped sprite it
should be easy to tell if a processor tries to
deinterlace (plus interpolate) or not.

You can change backgrounds with $A.
