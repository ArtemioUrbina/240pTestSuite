                GRID SCROLL TEST

A grid is scrolled vertically or horizontally,
which can be used to test linearity of the signal
and how well the display or video processor copes
with scrolling and framerate.

Button $Y can be used to toggle between horizontal
and vertical, while the d-pad regulates speed. 
Button $A stops the scroll and button $X changes
direction.
