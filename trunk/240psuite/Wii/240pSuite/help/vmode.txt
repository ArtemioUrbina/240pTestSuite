                VIDEO MODES (1/4)

The $H version of the 240p suite supports the 
following video modes:

#YNTSC compatible modes (60hz):#Y The first 21
lines of NTSC are reserved and cannot contain 
video material in broadcast standards, since 
line 21 usually has close caption (CC) data.
Console games typically respect this, since 
their target display were consumer TVs. It has
525 lines in interlaced mode, of which only 480
are visible, 240 in each field. The following
modes start at line 22 of every field.

                                   #C(cont...)#C

 #G240p:#G The progressive variant of NTSC 525i
    line video, it has 262 lines of which 240
    video lines are active. This format is 
    used in most SD game consoles, from the 
    #YAtari VCS#Y to the #YPS2#Y. The $H version
    of the suite displays a full 320x240p screen.

 #G480i scaled 240p assets (NTSC):#G This displays
    the 240p patterns in 480i mode. It uses the 
    480 visible lines, 240 in each field. The 
    whole content of the suite is linedoubled in 
    this mode.

 #G480i mixed 480p/240p assets (1:1/NTSC):#G This
    mode has an identical 480i NTSC signal, and
    the content of the suite is never line doubled.
    As a result, most screens end up filling 1/4th
    of the screen in 1:1 pixel mode. However, 
    there are several patterns in 480 resolution
    that fill the screen, such as the grid, scroll
    and overscan.

be enabled from the #YOptions#Y menu.
