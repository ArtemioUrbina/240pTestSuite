                VIDEO MODES (1/8)

The $H version of the 240p suite supports the 
following video modes:

#YNTSC compatible modes (60hz):#Y The first 21
lines of NTSC are reserved and cannot contain 
video material in broadcast standards, since 
line 21 usually has close caption (CC) data.
Console games typically respect this, since 
their target display were consumer TVs. It has
525 lines in interlaced mode, of which only 480
are visible, 240 in each field. The following
modes start at line 22 of every field.

                                   #C(cont...)#C
                VIDEO MODES (2/8)

 #G240p:#G The progressive variant of NTSC 525i
    line video, it has 262 lines of which 240
    video lines are active. This format is 
    used in most SD game consoles, from the 
    #YAtari VCS#Y to the #YPS2#Y. The $H version
    of the suite displays a full 320x240p screen.

 #G480i scaled 240p assets (NTSC):#G This displays
    the 240p patterns in 480i mode. It uses the 
    480 visible lines, 240 in each field. The 
    whole content of the suite is linedoubled in 
    this mode.

                VIDEO MODES (3/8)

 #G480i mixed 480p/240p assets (1:1/NTSC):#G This
    mode has an identical 480i NTSC signal, and
    the content of the suite is never line 
    doubled.

    As a result, most screens end up filling 1/4th
    of the screen in 1:1 pixel mode. However, 
    there are several patterns in 480 resolution
    that fill the screen, such as the grid, scroll
    and overscan.

                VIDEO MODES (4/8)

#YPAL compatible modes (50hz):#Y These modes must
be enabled from the #YOptions#Y menu.  The first
22 lines of PAL are reserved and cannot contain
video material in broadcast standards. Console 
games typically respect this, since their target 
display were consumer TVs. It has 625 lines in 
interlaced mode, of which only 576 are visible, 
288 in each field. 

The $H cannot use the whole 288 lines as active
video while doing 1:1 pixel mapping, instead it
can draw 264 lines on each field.

                VIDEO MODES (5/8)

In order to help overcome this limitation, the
240p suite adds several options for evaluation of
PAL modes. 

The first and recommended one, is using the #GPAL 
starting line#G option. It allows the PAL active
video to start at either line 23 1/2, 24, centered
in the signal, or at the bottom of the signal. 
This allows using the 264/528 patterns to verify
overscan, alignment, geometry, etc.

                VIDEO MODES (6/8)

The other option - #GStretch to full 288/576#G - must
only be used to visually check how the whole video
signal is filled. It works by using the same 
264/528 patterns stretched by the $H hardware to 
fill the active video, resulting in distorted 
patterns that are not 1:1 pixel mapped. 

Finally, the #GEnable PAL Background#G option fills
the whole screen with the selected color, enabling
visualization of the full 264/528 active video 
signal when the menu or pattern shown does not 
match the current resolution. This can be combined 
with the stretched video option as well.

                VIDEO MODES (7/8)

The following modes start at line 23 1/2 of every
field, as the PAL standard determines.

 #G288p#G: The progressive variant of PAL 625i
    line video, it has 312 lines of which 288
    video lines are active. This format is 
    used in most SD game consoles. The $H version
    of the suite displays a 320x264p screen.

 #G576i scaled 264/240p assets (PAL):#G This displays
    the 264p patterns in 576i mode. It uses the 
    528 visible lines, 264 in each field. The 
    whole content of the suite is linedoubled in 
    this mode.                     #C(cont...)#C
                VIDEO MODES (8/8)

#G576i 528/480/240p assets (1:1/PAL):#G This
    mode has an identical 576i PAL signal, and
    the content of the suite is never line 
    doubled.

    As a result, most screens end up filling 1/4th
    of the screen in 1:1 pixel mode. However, 
    there are several patterns in 528 resolution
    that fill the screen, such as the grid, scroll
    and overscan.

All of these PAL modes do have a stretched variant
when that option is enabled.
