#GEnable PAL Background:#G Since most of the menus
    and screens are designed for 240p, this fills
    the borders with the selected color, however
    there are specific PAL patterns that do not 
    need this, such as grids and overscan.

    the PAL background.

#GPAL starting line:#G PAL specifies the start of
    video data at line 23 1/2, this setting allows
    starting from line 24, centering the 528 
    active video lines in the 576i signal or 
    moving the whole screen to the bottom. The #GGC#G
    version starts at line 23.
                
#GStretch to full 288/576:#G Since the $H can't render
    the full 288p/576i screen in 1:1 pixel 
    mapping, this option enables a video mode for 
    all PAL settings where the 264/528 lines are 
    stretched vertically to fill the 576i PAL 
    signal. #YThis is uneven and should only be 
    used to visually check for overscan.#Y  #C(cont...)#C

    different button layout since it doesn't have
    a HOME button. This changes the layout for it.
