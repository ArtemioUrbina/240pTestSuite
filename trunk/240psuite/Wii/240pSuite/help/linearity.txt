                LINEARITY

This pattern shows 5 circles, that are matched
to the 10:11 NTSC pixel aspect ratio.

The diameter of the 4 small ones is identical, 
so as a group the linearity of the display or
upscaler can be verified by measuring them.

Of course, the diameter of the central circle 
should also be maintained in all directions.
