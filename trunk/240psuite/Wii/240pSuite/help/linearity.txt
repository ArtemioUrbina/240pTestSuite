                    LINEARITY

This pattern shows 5 circles, that are matched
to the 10:11 NTSC and the 59:54 PAL aspect ratios
depending on the currently selected resolution.

The linearity of the display or upscaler can be 
verified by measuring the diameter of the circles.
Of course the linearity should be kept in all 
directions.

A grid is also available with the $L and $R 
buttons.
