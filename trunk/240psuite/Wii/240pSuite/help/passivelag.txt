               LAG TEST (1/2)

This test is designed to be used with two displays
conected at the same time. One being a CRT, or a
display with a known lag as reference, and the
other the display to test.

Using a camera, a picture should be taken of both
screens at the same time. The picture will show 
the frame discrepancy between them. 

The circles in the bottom help determine the frame
even when the numbers are blurry.

The Sega Genesis version of the test can be used
with a Nomad as the reference display.   (cont...)

You can also chain the output ports of a PVM/BVM
to an upscaler and use the CRT as reference.
