              CHECKERBOARD 1/2

This pattern shows all the visible pixels in an
alternating white and black grid array. 

You can toggle the pattern with button $X, or
turn on auto-toggle each frame with the $A button.

When auto-toggle is set, you should see it
alternating rapidly. On some setups, the pattern
doesn't change at all. This means that the signal
is being treated as 480i and odd or even frames 
are being discarded completely.

              CHECKERBOARD 2/2

A frame counter can be displayed on screen by 
pressing button $Y.

Unfortunately the Wii cannot resolve this pattern
correctly in full 480p mode as other consoles,
but 240p and 480i resolve just fine.
