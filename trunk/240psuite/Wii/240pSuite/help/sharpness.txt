                    SHARPNESS

You should set the sharpness of your CRT to a
value that shows clean black and gray transitions,
with no white ghosting in between.

On most modern displays, the #Ysharpness#Y control is 
an edge-enhancement control, and most probably
should be set to zero, or in the middle.

In some #YPVM#Y/#YBVM#Y displays this is also referred 
to as #Yaperture#Y.
