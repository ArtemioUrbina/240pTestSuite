                WHITE SCREEN

This pattern allows you to calibrate each color:
Red, Green and Blue; as  well as the white level.

This pattern can be changed between white, black,
red, green and blue full screens using the + and 
- buttons. Some displays and scalers cannot have
issues when changing between a fully black and 
a fully white screen.

It can also be used to check color purity, and 
dead pixels.
