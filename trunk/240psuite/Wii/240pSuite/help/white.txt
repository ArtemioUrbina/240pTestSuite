                   WHITE SCREEN

This pattern can be changed between white, black,
red, green and blue full screens using the $R and 
$L buttons.

Some displays and scalers have issues when
changing between a fully black and a fully white
screen.

It can also be used to check color purity, and 
for dead pixels.

Pressing $A while displaying the black screen and 
in NTSC modes will toggle between 7.5 IRE and the 
0 IRE below black levels.
