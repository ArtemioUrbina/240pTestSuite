                  OVERSCAN

With this pattern you can interactively find out
the overscan in pixels and percentage of each
edge in a display. 

Use the $R and $L buttons to increment the 
overscan until you see the red border, then go 
back one pixel. The resulting number is the
amount of overscan in pixels in each direction.
