                     OVERSCAN

With this pattern you can interactively find out
the overscan in pixels and percentage of each
edge in a display. 

Use the $R and $L buttons to increment the 
overscan until you see the red border, then go 
back one pixel. The resulting number is the
amount of overscan in pixels in each direction.

#YWhen in 576i stretched PAL modes, the pixel
count is not accurate#Y. For precise results, 
instead use the #GPAL start line option#G in #Y23 1/2#Y
and #YBottom#y modes, each one to count top or bottom
overscan accurately.
