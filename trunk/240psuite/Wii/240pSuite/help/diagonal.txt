            Diagonal line patterns

These patterns can be used to adjust the vertical
and horizontal scaling in video procesors in
different resolutions. The test uses higher 
resolution assets for 480p when in that mode.

The angle increment for line rotation can be
adjusted by fractions up to 1/20th of a degree
with $X and $Y. The angle can be adjusted with
$L and $R.

The bars can be set to autorotate with $A and the
bars can be toggled to full screen by pressing Up.
