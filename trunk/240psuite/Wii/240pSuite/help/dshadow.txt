                DROP SHADOW TEST 

This is a crucial test for 240p upscan converters.
It displays a simple sprite shadow (32x32 pixels)
against a background, but the shadow is shown only
on each other frame. On a CRT this achieves a
transparency effect, since you are watching a 30hz
shadow on a 60hz signal. No background detail
should be lost and the shadow should be visible. 

The user can toggle the frame used to draw the
shadow with the Y button. Backgrounds can be
switched with the A button and the B button
toggles sprites.
