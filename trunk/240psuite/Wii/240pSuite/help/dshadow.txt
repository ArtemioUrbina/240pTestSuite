                DROP SHADOW TEST 

This is a crucial test for 240p upscan converters.
It displays a simple sprite shadow (32x32 pixels)
against a background, but the shadow is shown only
on each other frame. On a CRT this achieves a
transparency effect, since you are watching a 30hz
shadow on a 60hz signal. No background detail
should be lost and the shadow should be visible. 

The user can toggle the frame used to draw the
shadow with button 1. Backgrounds can be
switched with the A button and button 2
toggles sprites.
