                    HELP (1/3)

The 240p Test Suite was designed with two goals
in mind:

1) Evaluate 240p signal processing on modern TV
sets and video processing equipment; and 

2) Provide calibration patterns generated on your
game console to help in properly calibrating the
display's black, white and color levels.

Help and options are available everywhere by

This version of the suite supports 240p, 288p, 
576i, 480i and 480p video modes. However, 480p is
only available via component cables. 

In 288p and 576i PAL modes, the system is capable
of drawing the whole visible signal, 264 and 528
lines respectively. However, since most screens
are only 240p tall, the suite centers them 
vertically. Grids and other 264p patterns are 
shown using the full resolution.

PAL and 480p modes must be enabled from the 
options menu.
