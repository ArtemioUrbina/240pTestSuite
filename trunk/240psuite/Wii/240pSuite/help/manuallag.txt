             MANUAL LAG TEST (1/3)

The main intention is to show a changing pattern
on the screen, and given a visual and repetitive
cue, play a beep alternating speakers. This
should show to some degree the lag (if present)
when processing the signal.

As an added feature, the user can click the A
button when the sprite is aligned with the one on
the background, and the offset in frames form the
actual intersection will be shown on screen. This
can be repeated ten times and the software will
calculate the average. Whenever the button was
pressed before the actual intersection frame, the
                                       (cont...)

result will be ignored (but still shown onscreen).
Button 1 can be used to change the direction
of the sprite from vertical to horizontal, or
display both at the same time.

Of course the evaluation is dependent on reflexes
and/or rhythm more than anything. The visual and
audio cues are the more revealing aspects which the
user should consider, of course the interactive
                                          (cont...)
             MANUAL LAG TEST (3/3)

factor can give an experienced player the hang of
the system when testing via different connections.

Since a frame is around 16 ms (1000/60), that value
must be considered the general error when using the
test results.
