              MANUAL LAG TEST (1/3)

The main intention is to show a changing pattern
on the screen, which can be complemented with 
audio and vibration on the controller if set. 
This should show to some degree any lag when  
processing the signal.

As an added feature, the user can click the $A
button when the sprite is aligned with the one on
the background, and the offset in frames form the
actual intersection will be shown on screen. This
can be repeated ten times and the software will
calculate the average. Whenever the button was
pressed before the actual intersection frame, the
                                        #C(cont...)#C
              MANUAL LAG TEST (2/3)

result will be ignored (but still shown onscreen).
Button $X can be used to change the direction
of the sprite from vertical to horizontal, or
display both at the same time.


#ROf course the evaluation is dependent on reflexes
and/or rhythm more than anything.#R The visual and
audio cues are the more revealing aspects which 
the user should consider, of course the interactive
factor can give an experienced player the hang of
the system when testing via different connections.

              MANUAL LAG TEST (3/3)

Since a frame is around 16 ms (1000/60) in NTSC 
and 20 ms (1000/50) in PAL, that value must be 
considered the general error when using the test 
results.
