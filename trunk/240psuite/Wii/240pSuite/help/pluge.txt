                 PLUGE (1/3)

The picture line-up generation equipment (PLUGE)
is a test pattern used to adjust the black level
and contrast of a video signal.

The pattern in this suite is mainly designed to
adjust the black level. The control for setting 
this on your TV is usually named "Brightness".

This adjustment ensures that anything intended
to be black is actually black, and allows all
detail to be seen on dark scenes.

There are three bars at each side, you can 
highlight them with the $X button.        (cont...)
                 PLUGE (2/3)

The $A button changes between NTSC and full range
(0-255) when in any NTSC mode.        
                                         
The values of the bars depend on your current
video mode. Reduce the Brightness until the 
desired bars are no longer visible, and then 
slowly raise it until they are *just* visible,
and go back one notch where they blend with the
background. 

Values for the bars when in NTSC mode are: the 
closest to the center are at 3.5 IRE, the central
ones at 7.5 IRE, and the outer ones at 11.5 IRE.

                 PLUGE (3/3)

When in calibrating for NTSC material, the 7.5 IRE
bars should blend in the background. The 7.5 IRE in
NTSC is the black level, also known as setup.

When in PAL mode or RGB Full Range, the 2 IRE bars 
are the ones you should calibrate against.
