#GStretch to full 576i:#G Since the $H can't render
    the full 288p/576i screen in 1:1 pixel 
    mapping, this option enables a video mode for 
    576i where the 528 lines are streched 
    vertically to fill the 576i PAL signal. #RThis 
    is uneven and should only be used to check for 
    overscan.#R
