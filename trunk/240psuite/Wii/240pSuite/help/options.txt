#GVI Trap Filter (Composite):#G A Trap filter is
    generally used to improve #YLuma#Y/#YChroma#Y
    separation in the #Ycomposite#Y video signal. When 
    disabled, the video signal is unfiltered, 
    which sometimes produces visual artefacts such 
    as color bleeding. A notch filter centered at 
    the color subcarrier frequency is used to 
    extract color from 2.5MHz to 4.5MHz.This method 
    has two drawbacks. First, it limits the color 
    bandwidth (which extends to 2.1MHz) cutting out
    fine color detail. Second, luminance info in 
    the notch frequency range contaminates color 
    and generates unwanted color or rainbows.

#GGX Deflickering Filter:#G A filter that removes
    ficker in interlaced modes by softening the
    rendered image. 

#GEnable 480p Modes:#G If a component cable is

#GEnable PAL Background:#G Since most of the menus
    and screens are designed for 240p, this fills
    the borders with the selected color, however
    there are specific PAL patterns that do not 
    need this, such as grids and overscan.

#GChange PAL Background:#G Select the fill color for
    the PAL background.

#GPAL starting line:#G PAL specifies the start of
    active video at line 23 1/2, this setting 
    allows starting from line 24, centering the 
    528 active video lines in the 576i signal or 
    moving it to the bottom.            #C(cont...)#C

#GStretch to full 288/576:#G Since the $H can't render
    the full 288p/576i screen in 1:1 pixel 
    mapping, this option enables a video mode for 
    all PAL settings where the 264/528 lines are 
    stretched vertically to fill the 576i PAL 
    signal. #YThis is uneven and should only be 
    used to visually check for overscan.#Y
                
#G480p Scanline Intensity:#G When in line doubled
    480p mode, the suite allows the display of
    rendered scanlines. This determines the alpha
    value for them, 0% to eliminates them.

#G480p Scanlines:#G This setting displays EVEN or
    ODD scanlines in 480p line doubled mode.

#GSFC Classic Controller:#G The #YSuper Famicom#Y
    version of the #YClassic Controller#Y needs a 
    different button layout since it doesn't have
    a HOME button. This changes the layout for it.


Holding $L and $R buttons while in the options menu
will reset all options to their defaults.
