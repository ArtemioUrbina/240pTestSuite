                  GRID (1/2)

This grid uses a 320x240 pattern, and should fill
all of the 4:3 visible area. 

You can use it to verify that all the visible area
is being displayed, and that there is no distortion
present.

A 640x480 Grid can be shown in compatible NTSC
video modes. 

In PAL resolutions, there are also two different 
grids.

                  GRID (1/2)

In the 288p PAL mode, only 320x264 are visible in
this hardware. Since 264 is not an exact multiple 
of 16, there is a centered line of smaller blue 
rectangles. 

In 576i unscaled 1:1 mode, a full 640x528 grid is
shown. This is also the maximum visible area for
that mode.
