                  GRID (1/2)

This grid uses a 320x240 pattern, and should fill
all of the 4:3 visible area. 

You can use it to verify that all the visible area
is being displayed, and that there is
no distortion present

A 640x480 Grid can be shown in compatible NTSC
video modes. 

In PAL resolutions, there are also two different 
grids. 

                                    (cont...)
                  GRID (1/2)

In 264 mode, only 263 active pixels are shown.

Since 264 is not an exact multiple of 16 there is
a centered line of smaller tiles.

When in 576i linedoubled mode, an extra green 
line is displayed at the bottom of the screen.

In 576i unscaled 1:1 mode, a full 640x576 grid is
shown.
