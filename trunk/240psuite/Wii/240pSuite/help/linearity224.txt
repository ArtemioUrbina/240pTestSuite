                LINEARITY 224p

This pattern shows 5 circles, that are matched
to the 10:11 NTSC, but limited to a 320x224 area.
This is a mock-up of the area shown in several
consoles, such as the SNES, Genesis and
Playstation, and also useful in monitors with
regular overscan.

The linearity of the display or upscaler can be 
verified by measuring the diameter of the circles.
Of course the linearity should be kept in all 
directions.

A grid is also available with the $L and $R 
buttons.
