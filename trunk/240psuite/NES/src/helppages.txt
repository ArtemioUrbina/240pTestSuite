== About ==

The 240p Test Suite was
designed with two goals in
mind:

1. Evaluate TV sets and
   video processors for ability
   to handle 240p signals.
2. Turn a game console into
   a test signal generator
   to help in calibrating the
   black, white, and color
   levels of a display.

The Nintendo Entertainment
System (NES) can output 240
picture lines in a progressive
"double struck" mode. It does
not support interlaced video,
and its 52-color palette is
closer to HSV than RGB.
----
Press Start in any test
pattern to show help for
that pattern.

The test suite is also
available for several other
consoles. For more info, visit

== PLUGE ==

The PLUGE (picture line-up
generation equipment)
pattern is used to help
adjust the black level
to a correct value.

The inner bars are a signal
level slightly lower than
standard black. The outer
bars are the darkest mix
of colors the NES can show.

You should adjust the TV's
"brightness" control until the
outer bars are clearly visible
and inner bars are not.

== Gradient color bars ==

This pattern allows you to
calibrate the red, green, and
blue colors on your TV.

Use the TV's "contrast"
control to adjust the white
level such that four levels
each of red, green, and blue
and three levels of white are
visible, and that the lightest
level of each color is distinct
from white.

Press A to hide or show
the 16px grid.

== SMPTE color bars ==

This pattern can be used to
calibrate for approximate
color levels.

A: Switch between light and
dark versions of the bars
Select: Toggle 1 kHz tone

With some TVs, you can turn
on blue-only mode to confirm
color balance. But because
the NES's composite encoder
does not attempt to produce
accurate RGB hues, these
colors will not be pure.

== 601 color bars ==

This pattern idea and
layout borrows form the
Digital Video Essentials
color adjust pattern.
It has a gray background
as reference and can be
used with color filters
to adjust color accuracy. 

A: Switch between light and
dark versions of the bars
Select: Toggle 1 kHz tone

With some TVs, you can turn
on blue-only mode to confirm
color balance. But because
the NES's composite encoder
does not attempt to produce
accurate RGB hues, these
colors will not be pure.

== Color bleed ==

This pattern helps diagnose
color bleed caused by
incorrect color resampling.

‚Üë‚Üì‚Üê‚Üí: Move the pattern
by one pixel
Hold ‚Üë‚Üì‚Üê‚Üí: Move the
pattern every frame
A: Switch among
horizontal, vertical, and
checkerboard patterns
Select: Show or hide a
frame counter

== Grid ==

This pattern uses the full
resolution of the screen.

You can use it to verify that
the entire picture is visible,
including the entire red
border, and that no distortion
is present.

A: Change between 256x224
and 256x240 pixel grids.
Be aware that many games
designed for NTSC display
may show artifacts outside
the 256x224 pixel area.

== Linearity ==

This pattern shows five
circles at the 8:7 pixel
aspect ratio of the NES PPU.

You can use it to verify that
a display or scaler has its
horizontal to vertical size
ratio set correctly or to
verify the lack of barrel
distortion on a CRT.

The diameter of each circle
should be the same in all
directions, and the diameter
of all four small circles
should be the same.

A: Hide or show a
square grid

== Gray ramp ==

This gray ramp should not
have a red, green, or blue
tint to it.

Some cheaper LCDs can have
different gamma curves for
the different components.

== Solid color screen ==

Some displays and scalers
have problems when changing
between solid black and solid
white or bright colors.
Some cables produce audio
buzzing while a white
screen is displayed.

‚Üê‚Üí: Change among solid
white, black, red, green,
and blue screens.
A on black screen: Switch
between black and below
black.
A on white screen: Enter
or leave custom color mode
‚Üë‚Üì: Change brightness
‚Üê‚Üí: Change hue

== IRE ==

Press Left and Right to
change the background
intensity.

Press A to change between a
light rectangle on black and
a dark rectangle on white.

== Sharpness ==

You should set the sharpness
of your TV to a value that
shows clean black and gray
transitions without white
ghost lines on the side.

On modern TVs, the
"sharpness" control performs
edge enhancement, which
is designed for live action
sources received through RF.
Some TVs have zero as
no change and high as
enhancement. Others have
middle as no change, high as
enhancement, and low as
blurring.

== Overscan ==

With this pattern you can
discover how much of the
picture edge your TV hides.

Historically, CRT TVs have
been calibrated to
"overscan", or draw the
picture slightly past the
visible area, in case aging
capacitors cause the picture
to shrink over time. This
continues into the modern
era, as a lot of productions
have unwanted information
in this overscan area.
----
Press a direction to choose
an edge of the screen. Then
hold A and press toward or
away from the edge to move
it. Move it inward until you
see the white border, then
move it back out one pixel.
The resulting number is the
amount of overscan in pixels
in each direction.

The NES picture is 256x240
pixels, with 12 pixels of
built-in border at the left
and right sides. This border
is not included in the
displayed amounts.

== Drop shadow sprite ==

This test draws a shadow
sprite on every other frame,
flickering at 30 or 25 Hz.
Such a flickering effect is
commonly used in games to
show transparency, such as
during mercy invincibility.

Use the Control Pad to move
the sprite. Whether still or
moving, no background detail
must be lost, and the shadow
must be shown without
horizontal stripes.

Press Select to change the
sprite's shape, or hold Select
and press Left or Right to
switch backgrounds.

== Striped sprite ==

Some deinterlacers can
display drop shadows
correctly but still interpret
240p as 480i. This striped
sprite should make it easier
to tell if a processor is trying
to deinterlace an image.

Use the Control Pad to
move the sprite. Hold Select
and press Left or Right to
switch backgrounds.

== Stopwatch ==

Use this test with two
displays connected at once.
One of them is being tested,
and the other (the reference)
should be either a CRT or
a display with known lag.

Use a digital camera to take
a picture of both screens at
the same time. The picture
will show the difference in
image processing latency
between them. For some
consumer LCD TVs, this
may exceed five frames.

The clock display at the
bottom helps determine
the frame even when the
numbers above are blurry.
----
You can also use this test
as a stopwatch.

A: Start/stop
Select when stopped: Reset
Select when running: Lap

== Manual lag test ==

This helps quantify a
display's processing lag by
showing a changing pattern
on the screen, optionally with
audio.

Press A when the moving
reticle aligns with the still
one to display the offset in
frames from the actual
intersection and whether it
was early or late. After ten
presses that are not early,
their average is shown.
----
Use the Control Pad to
change the direction of the
moving reticle (horizontal,
vertical, or both).

Results will be more accurate
if you are skilled at rhythm
games such as Konami's
Dance Dance Revolution or
Activision's Guitar Hero.

== Hill zone scroll test ==

This test shows a background
from a video game. It can be
used to notice any drops in
frame rate.

Press Up or Down to change
the speed. Press Left or
Right to change the direction.
Press A to stop or start.

== Grid scroll test ==

A grid is scrolled vertically
or horizontally, which can be
used to test linearity and how
well the display copes with
scrolling and frame rate.

Press Up or Down to change
the speed. Hold A and press a
direction to change direction.
Press A to stop or start.

== Full screen stripes ==

You should see a pattern of
lines, each one pixel in height.

‚Üë‚Üì‚Üê‚Üí: Move the pattern
by one pixel
Hold ‚Üë‚Üì‚Üê‚Üí: Move the
pattern every frame
A: Switch among
horizontal, vertical, and
checkerboard patterns
Select: Show or hide a
frame counter
----
When the pattern is moving
continuously, you should see
the lines flicker. If continuous
movement produces a still
image, your processor is
treating the signal as
interlaced and either
discarding every other frame
or combining them incorrectly.

== Backlight zone test ==

This test lets you check how
the display's backlight works
with small bright areas. Some
LED-lit LCDs dim darker
areas in order to achieve
blacker blacks, but this
causes problems with scenes
such as starfields.

Use the Control Pad to move
a small square. Press Select
to change its size among 1, 2,
4, or 8 pixels on a side.
Press A to hide or show it in
order to test transitions to
and from a black screen.

== Sound test ==

Use this test to ensure that
the audio output is working
and that audio and video are
synchronized.

Press A to play a sound and
show a sprite while it is
playing.
