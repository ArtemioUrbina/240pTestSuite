== About ==

The 240p Test Suite was
designed with two goals in
mind:

1. Evaluate TV sets and
   video processors for ability
   to handle 240p signals.
2. Turn a game console into
   a test signal generator
   to help in calibrating the
   black, white, and color
   levels of a display.

The Nintendo Entertainment
System (NES) can output 240
picture lines in a progressive
"double struck" mode. It does
not support interlaced video,
and its 52-color palette is
closer to HSV than RGB.
----
Press Start in any test
pattern to show help for
that pattern.

The test suite is also
available for several other
consoles. For more info, visit
http://junkerhq.net/240p

== PLUGE ==

The PLUGE (picture line-up
generation equipment)
pattern is used to help
adjust the black level
to a correct value.

The inner bars are a signal
level slightly lower than
standard black. The outer
bars are the darkest mix
of colors the NES can show.

You should adjust the TV's
"brightness" control until the
outer bars are clearly visible
and inner bars are not.
----
A: Darken the entire screen
by 25% with emphasis filter
Select: Switch outer bars
between gray and color

The emphasis filter and gray
outer bars may misbehave on
NES consoles modded with
a 2C03 or 2C05 RGB PPU
taken from a Vs. System or
PlayChoice 10 arcade board.

== Gradient color bars ==

This pattern allows you to
calibrate the red, green, and
blue colors on your TV.

Use the TV's "contrast"
control to adjust the white
level such that four levels
each of red, green, and blue
and three levels of white
are visible, and the lightest
level of each color is
distinct from white.

A: Hide or show 16px grid

== SMPTE color bars ==

This pattern can be used to
calibrate for approximate
color levels.

A: Switch between light and
dark versions of the bars
Select: Toggle 1 kHz tone

With some TVs, you can turn
on blue-only mode to confirm
color balance. But because
the NES's composite encoder
does not attempt to produce
accurate RGB hues, these
colors will not be pure.

== Color bars on gray ==

This pattern shows color
bars on a gray background.
Ideally, it would be used
with color filters to adjust
color balance. But as with
SMPTE bars, the NES PPU's
non-RGB model breaks the
blue filter trick.

A: Switch between light and
dark versions of the bars
Select: Toggle 1 kHz tone

Essentials: HD Basics

== Color bleed ==

This pattern helps diagnose
color bleed caused by
incorrect color resampling.

↑↓←→: Move the
  pattern by one pixel
Hold ↑↓←→: Move the
  pattern every frame
A: Switch among
  horizontal, vertical,
  and diagonal patterns
Select: Show or hide
  frame counter

== Grid ==

This pattern uses the full
resolution of the screen.
You can use it to verify that
the entire picture is visible,
including the entire red
border, with no distortion.

A: Change between 256x224
   and 256x240 pixel grids

Be aware that many games
designed for NTSC display
may show artifacts outside
the 256x224 pixel area.

== Linearity ==

This pattern shows five
circles at the 8:7 pixel
aspect ratio of the NES PPU.

You can use it to verify that
a display or scaler has its
horizontal to vertical size
ratio set correctly or to
verify the lack of barrel
distortion on a CRT.

The diameter of each circle
should be the same in all
directions, and the diameter
of all four small circles
should be the same.

A: Hide or show a
   square grid

== Gray ramp ==

This gray ramp should not
have a red, green, or blue
tint to it.

Some cheaper LCDs can have
different gamma curves for
the different components.

== Solid color screen ==

Some displays and scalers
have problems when changing
between solid black and
solid white or bright colors.
Some cables produce audio
buzzing while a white
screen is displayed.

←→: Change among solid
  white, black, red, green,
  and blue screens
A on black screen:
  Switch between black
  and below black
A on white screen: Enter or
  leave custom color mode
↑↓: Change brightness
←→: Change hue

== IRE ==

This test shows a rectangle
centered on the screen and
displays its brightness as a
percentage of standard white.
The display should not lose
sync even when brightness
becomes negative.

←→: Change brightness
A: Toggle emphasis

== Sharpness ==

You should set the sharpness
of your TV to a value that
shows clean black and gray
transitions without white
ghost lines on the side.

On modern TVs, the
"sharpness" control performs
edge enhancement, which
is designed for live action
sources received through RF.
Some TVs have zero as
no change and high as
enhancement. Others have
middle as no change, high
as enhancement, and low
as blurring.

== CPU clock speed ==

Kevin Horton's Hi-Def NES
mod includes a feature to
overclock the NES CPU to
reduce slowdown in games.
This test measures the CPU's
clock rate using the length
of a scanline as a time base.

Though the NES has no
real-time clock, a program
can measure the clock rate
relative to the PPU's roughly
15.7 kHz horizontal retrace.
This frequency cannot be
changed without causing
the display to lose color
or even lose sync.
----
Then it uses NMI and sprite
0 timing to measure cycles
per frame and per scanline.
It guesses the hsync rate
based on whether the PPU
is making 262 or 312 lines:

  NTSC: 15745.80 Hz
  PAL:   15602.18 Hz

From this, it calculates
CPU clock speed.
It repeats this calculation
every few frames, so if you
change the CPU's speed
while the test runs, the
displayed value will update.

== Overscan ==

With this pattern you can
discover how much of the
picture edge your TV hides.

Historically, CRT TVs
have been calibrated to
"overscan", or draw the
picture slightly past the
visible area, in case aging
capacitors cause the picture
to shrink over time. This
continues into the modern
era, as a lot of productions
have unwanted information
in this overscan area.

↑↓←→: Choose an edge
Hold A + ↑↓←→:
  Move that edge
----
Move each edge inward until
you see the white border,
then go back one pixel. Or
leave one white pixel visible
and subtract 1. The result
is the amount of overscan
in pixels in each direction.

The NES picture is 256x240
pixels. The nominal 4:3 frame
on NTSC is 280x240, including
12 pixels of border at left
and right. This border is not
included in the displayed
amounts.

PAL NES border is always
black. It covers 2 pixels
of the left and right sides
and 1 on the top.

== Shadow sprite ==

This test draws a shadow
sprite on every other frame,
flickering at 30 or 25 Hz.
Many games use such a
flickering effect to show
transparency, such as
during mercy invincibility.

Some deinterlacers can
display drop shadows
correctly but still interpret
240p as 480i. This striped
sprite should make it easier
to tell if a processor is trying
to deinterlace an image.
----
↑↓←→: Move sprite
A: Skip flicker frame or
  change stripe direction
A+↑: Change shadow type
  (flicker or stripes)
A+←→: Change background
Select: Change sprite shape

Whether still or moving, no
background detail must be
lost, and the shadow must
not disappear. The flicker
pattern must not have
horizontal stripes.

== Stopwatch ==

This stopwatch helps you
measure a TV's lag, detect
dropped frames, or just
count how long your spouse
has been on the phone.

A: Start/stop
Select when stopped: Reset
Select when running: Lap

The throbber at the bottom
helps determine the frame
even when the numbers above
are blurry.
----
Lag measurement

Connect two displays at once.
One is being tested, and the
other (the reference) should
be either a CRT SDTV or
a display with known lag.
For example, on a front-
loading NES, you can connect
an old CRT to the RF out
and your scaler to the AV.

Use a digital camera to take
a picture of both screens at
the same time. The picture
will show the difference in
image processing latency
between them. For some
consumer LCD TVs, this
may exceed five frames.
----
Dropped frames

A scaler with a frame buffer
may drop frames because the
frame rate of the NTSC NES
and Super NES (60.10 Hz) is
faster than standard (59.94
Hz).

At 59.94 Hz, it would drop
one frame out of 345: one per
5.75 seconds or two per 11.5.
At 60.00 Hz, it would drop
one frame out of 607: one per
10.12 s or two per 20.24.

Kevin Horton's Hi-Def NES
mod compensates for this
difference by slowing down
the CPU and PPU.

== Manual lag test ==

This helps quantify a
display's processing lag by
showing a changing pattern
on the screen, optionally
with audio.

Press A when the moving
reticle aligns with the still
one to display the offset
in frames from the actual
intersection and whether it
was early or late. After ten
presses that are not early,
their average is shown.
----
↑↓: Choose a setting
←→: Change setting's value

Settings include the direction
of the moving reticle
(horizontal, vertical, or both),
whether the movement timing
is randomized, and whether to
beep when the reticles align.

Results will be more accurate
if you are skilled at rhythm
games such as Konami's
Dance Dance Revolution or
Activision's Guitar Hero.

== Hill zone scroll test ==

This test shows a scrolling
background resembling a
popular video game, with
several parallax strips.
It can be used to notice
any drops in frame rate.

↑↓: Change speed
←→: Change direction
A: Stop or start

== Grid scroll test ==

A grid is scrolled vertically
or horizontally. This can be
used to test linearity and
how well the display copes
with scrolling and frame rate.
Some scalers may produce a
still image at maximum speed.

↑↓: Change speed
A: Stop or start
A + ↑↓←→: Change direction

== Full screen stripes ==

You should see a pattern of
lines, each one pixel wide.

↑↓←→: Move the
  pattern by one pixel
Hold ↑↓←→: Move the
  pattern every frame
A: Switch among
  horizontal, vertical,
  and diagonal patterns
Select: Show or hide
  frame counter
----
While you hold the Control
Pad, the lines should flicker.
If holding a direction makes
a still image, your processor
is treating the signal as
interlaced and either
discarding every other frame
or weaving them incorrectly.

== Backlight zone test ==

This test displays a small
moving square, letting you
check how a display's
backlight works with small
bright areas. Some LED-lit
LCDs dim darker areas to
make black areas darker,
which causes problems with
scenes such as starfields.

↑↓←→: Move the square
Select: Change its size among
  1, 2, 4, or 8 pixels on a side
A: Hide or show the square

== Sound test: Frequency ==

	8000 Hz
	4000 Hz
	2000 Hz
	1000 Hz
	500 Hz
	250 Hz
	125 Hz
	62 Hz
	31 Hz
	1000 Hz (pulse)

== Sound test ==

Use this test to ensure that
the audio output is working
and that audio and video are
synchronized.

Press A to play a sound and
change the screen color
while it is playing.
