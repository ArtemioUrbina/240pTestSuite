             HORIZONTAL STRIPES (1/2)

This pattern is designed to show if all lines are
visible in your setup, and how your video
processor is handling 240p video. 

You should see a pattern of lines, each one pixel
in height, starting with a white one at the top of
the screen. You can toggle the pattern with the R
trigger, or turn on auto-toggle each frame with the
A button.

When auto-toggle is set, you should see the lines
alternating rapidly. On some setups, the pattern
doesn't change at all. This means that the signal
                                         #C(cont...)#C
             HORIZONTAL STRIPES (2/2)

is being treated as 480i/576i and odd or even 
frames are being discarded completely.

A frame counter can be displayed on screen by 
pressing the #GX#G button.

You can also display vertical bars by pressing #GY#G,
that pattern will help you evaluate if the signal
is not distorted horizontaly, since all lines 
should be one pixel wide.
