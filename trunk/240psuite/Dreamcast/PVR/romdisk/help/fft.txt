            SIP MICROPHONE AND FFT 

This test can be used to measure display lag if
both video and audio follow the same chain.

It uses Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to detect the
audio delay by playing a 1Khz tone and accurately
calculating the frame delay.

The L and R triggers allow you to change the 
precision of the FFT used to calculate the audio
delay.
