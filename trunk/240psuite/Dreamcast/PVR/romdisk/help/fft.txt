            SIP MICROPHONE AND FFT 

This test can be used to measure display lag if
both video and audio follow the same chain.

It uses Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to detect the
audio delay by playing a 1Khz tone and precisely
calculating the frame delay.

The L and R triggers allow you to change the frame
accuracy of the FFT used to estimate the audio
delay. This ranges from 1 frame to 1/4th of a frame
(16.67ms to 4.16ms). The smaller the frame accuracy,
the higher the probability of small errors; since
the Dreamcast's microphone samples rate is 11Khz.
All settings are within the hardware capabilities.
