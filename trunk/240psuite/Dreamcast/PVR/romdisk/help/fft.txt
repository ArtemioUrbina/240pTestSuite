            SIP MICROPHONE AND FFT 

This test can be used to measure display lag if
both video and audio follow the same chain.

It uses #YFast Fourier Transform#Y (FFT) to detect the
audio delay by playing a #G1Khz#G tone and precisely
calculating the frame delay.

The #GL#G and #GR#G triggers allow you to change the frame
accuracy of the FFT used to estimate the audio
delay. This ranges from 1 frame to 1/4th of a frame
(16.67ms to 4.16ms). The smaller the frame accuracy,
the higher the probability of small errors; since
the #YDreamcast#Y's microphone samples rate is 11Khz.
All settings are within the hardware capabilities.
