                     OVERSCAN

With this pattern you can interactively find out
the overscan in pixels and percentage of each
edge in a display. 

Use the #GR#G and #GL#G triggers to increment the 
overscan until you see the white border, then go 
back one pixel. The resulting number is the
amount of overscan in pixels in each direction.

The #GA#G button resets all borders to zero.

For precise results in PAL modes, use the #GPAL
start line option#G in #YTop#Y and #YBottom#Y modes,
each one to count top or bottom overscan accurately.
