                      GRID

This grid uses the full 320x240 resoolution, and
should fill your display's 4:3 visible area. 

You can use it to verify that all the visible 
area is being displayed, and that there is no
distortion present

NOTE: When using Composite, SCART/RGB-21 or
S-Video the last line is not visible. This is not
a probelm with your display. To help you set it
up, use the D-PAD to move the pattern. When doing
this, an offset will be displayed on the top
right corner of the screen.
