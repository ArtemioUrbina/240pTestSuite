                      GRID

This grid uses a 320x239 pattern, and should 
fill all of the 4:3 visible area. 

You can use it to verify that all the visible 
area is being displayed, and that there is no
distortion present

NOTE: When using Composite, SCART/RGB-21 or
S-Video only 239 lines are visible and that is 
the reason this pattern only uses 239 pixels.
When using VGA, all 240 lines are visible, and
you'll notice a green line at the bottom of the
screen. As a result the central row of pixels 
in the grid is only 1 pixel tall.
