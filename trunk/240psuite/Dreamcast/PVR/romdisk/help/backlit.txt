              Backlit Test (1/2)

This test allows you to check how the display's
backlit works when only a small array of pixels
is shown. This can be very revealing, and can
be used to detect the zones in LED backlit 
displays, or to evaluate global and local
dimming.

The user can move around the white pixel arrays
with the d-pad or joystiq, and change the size
of the pixel array with "A" and "B". The "Y"
button allows the user to hide the pixel array
in order to alternate a fully black screen.

              Backlit Test (2/2)
It might be necessary to have a fully-off panel
(if possible) when displaying the black 
background,  in order to evaluate full-backlit
displays by adjusting brightness accordingly for
this test.
