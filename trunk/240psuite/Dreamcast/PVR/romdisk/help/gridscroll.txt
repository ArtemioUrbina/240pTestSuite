                GRID SCROLL TEST

A grid is scrolled vertically or horizontally,
which can be used to test linearity of the signal
and how well the display copes with scrolling.

The X button can be used to toggle between
horizontal and vertical, while the d-pad regulates
speed; A button stops and the Y button changes
direction.
