                GRID SCROLL TEST

A grid is scrolled vertically or horizontally,
which can be used to test linearity of the signal
and how well the display copes with scrolling.

The #GX#G button can be used to toggle between
horizontal and vertical, while the d-pad regulates
speed; #GA#G button stops and the #GY#G button changes
direction.
