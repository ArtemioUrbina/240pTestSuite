              SMPTE COLOR BARS (1/2)

In an SMPTE color bar image, the top two-thirds
of the television picture contain seven vertical
bars of 75% intensity. In order from left to
right, the colors are gray, yellow, cyan, green,
magenta, red, and blue. This sequence runs 
through all seven possible combinations that use
at least one of the three basic color components
of green, red, and blue, with blue cycling on 
and off between every bar, red cycling on and 
off every two bars, and green on for the leftmost
four bars and off for the rightmost three.

              SMPTE COLOR BARS (2/2)

Below the main set of seven bars is a strip of 
blue, magenta, cyan, and white castellations. 
When a television receiver is set to filter out 
all colors except for blue, these castellations, 
combined with the main set of color bars, are 
used to properly adjust the color controls; they
appear as four solid blue bars, with no visible 
distinction between the bars and the 
castellations, if the color controls are properly
adjusted.
