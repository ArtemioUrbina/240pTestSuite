                  LINEARITY 224

This pattern shows 5 circles, that are matched
to the 10:11 NTSC aspect ratio.

The linearity of the display or upscaler can be 
verified by measuring the diameter of the circles.
Of course the linearity should be kept in all 
directions.

A grid is also available with the #GX#G and #GY#G 
buttons.
