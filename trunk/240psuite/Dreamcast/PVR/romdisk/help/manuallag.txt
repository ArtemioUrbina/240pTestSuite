             MANUAL LAG TEST (1/3)

The main intention is to show a changing pattern
on the screen, and given a visual and repetitive
cue, play a beep alternating speakers. This
should show to some degree the lag (if present)
when processing the signal.

As an added feature, the user can click the #GA#G
button when the sprite is aligned with the one on
the background, and the offset in frames from the
actual intersection will be shown on screen. This
can be repeated ten times and the software will
calculate the average. Whenever the button was
pressed before the actual intersection frame, the
                                       #C(cont...)#C
             MANUAL LAG TEST (2/3)

result will be ignored (but still shown onscreen).
The #GX#G button can be used to change the direction
of the sprite from vertical to horizontal, or
display both at the same time.

The #GR#G trigger can be used to turn off the audio cue.
If a #YPurupuru#Y (Jump pack) is found, it will be used
as well, it can be activated with the #GL#G trigger.

The interval of movement can be rythmic or random,
and this can be toggled with the #GY#G button.

#ROf course the evaluation is dependent on reflexes
and/or rhythm more than anything.#R The visual and
audio cues are the more revealing aspects which the
user should considers. Of course the interactive
factor can give an experienced player the hang of
the system when testing via different connections.

Since a frame is around 16 ms (1000/60) in NTSC
and 20ms (1000/50) in PAL,  that value must be
considered the general error when using the
test results.
