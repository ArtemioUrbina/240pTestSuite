                  COLORBARS 1/2

This pattern allows you to calibrate each color:
Red, Green and Blue; as  well as the white level.

This is adjusted in the same way black levels
are set with the PLUGE. If you adjusted the black
level correctly with the PLUGE, the rectangles 
under the "1" column should be barely visible.

Adjust the white level first, this is done using
the "Contrast" control on your TV set. Raise it
until you cannot distinguish between the blocks
under "E" and "F", and lower it slowly until you
can clearly tell them appart.

                  COLORBARS 2/2

The same procedure should be used with each
color, raise the control that adjusts the
individual color level (not the color/tint one)
until you can't tell the box under "F" from the
one under "E", and then lower it until you can
distinguish them clearly. 

Repeat for each color and you are set.
