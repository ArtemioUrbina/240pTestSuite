                    PLUGE 1/2

The picture line-up generation equipment (PLUGE)
is a test pattern used to adjust the black level
and contrast of a video signal.

The pattern in this suite is mainly designed to
adjust the black level. The control for setting 
this on your TV is usualy named "Brightness".

Reduce the Brightness until these bars: 
<>   <->   <-                        ->   <->   <>
are no longer visible, and then slowly raise it
until they are *just* visible.

                    PLUGE 2/2

There are three bars on each side, bars closer
to the center are at 3.5%, the center ones at 4%
and the outer ones are at 5%. Since the Dreamcast
color is 5 bits per pixel (or 5-6-5 in the best
case), 3.5% is the lowest level of black it can
display.

This adjustment assures that anything intended
to be black is actually black, and allows all
detail to be seen on dark scenes.
