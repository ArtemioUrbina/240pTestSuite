                   PLUGE (1/3)

The #Ypicture line-up generation equipment#Y (PLUGE)
is a test pattern used to adjust the black level
and contrast of a video signal.

The pattern in this suite is mainly designed to
adjust the black level. The control for setting 
this on your TV is usually named #YBrightness#Y.

This adjustment ensures that anything intended
to be black is actually black, and allows all
detail to be seen on dark scenes.

There are three bars at each side, you can 
highlight them with the #GY#G button.        #C(cont...)#C
                   PLUGE (2/3)

The #GA#G button changes between #GNTSC#G and #GRGB Full 
Range#G [0-255] when in any NTSC mode.        
                                         
The values of the bars depend on your current
video mode. Reduce the #YBrightness#Y until the 
desired bars are no longer visible, and then 
slowly raise it until they are #Gjust#G visible,
and go back one notch where they blend with the
background. 

In NTSC there are three bars on each side, bars
closer to the center are at 4%, the center ones at
7.5% and the outer ones are at 10%. Since the #Y240p#Y
                                         #C(cont...)#C
                   PLUGE (3/3)

#Ytest suite#Y uses the 5 bits per pixel color mode
(5-6-5 in reality), 4% is the lowest level of
black it can display.

When calibrating for NTSC material, the 7.5 IRE
bars should blend in the background. The 7.5 IRE
in NTSC is the black level, also known as setup.

When in PAL mode or #GRGB Full Range#G, the 4 IRE 
bars are the ones you should calibrate against,
and the 3 IRE bars are invisible due to HW
limitations, that's why they are marked as 0 IRE
in the highlight.
