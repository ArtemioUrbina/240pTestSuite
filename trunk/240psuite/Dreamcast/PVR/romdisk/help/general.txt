                    HELP (1/4)

The 240p Test Suite was designed with two goals
in mind:

1) Evaluate 240p signal processing on modern TV
sets and video processing equipment; and 

2) Provide calibration patterns generated on your
game console to help in properly calibrating the
display's black, white and color levels.

Help is available everywhere by pressing the
#GStart#G button. Use right and left in the d-pad to
navigate between help pages.

This version of the suite supports 240p, 288p, 
576i, 480i and 480p video modes. However, 480p is
only available when using a #YVGA (D-SUB) box#Y.

In 288p and 576i PAL modes, the system is capable
of drawing the whole visible signal, 264 and 528
lines respectively. However, since most screens
are only 240p tall, the suite centers them 
vertically. Grids and other 264p patterns are 
shown using the full resolution.

PAL modes must be enabled from the options menu.

The #YDreamcast#Y microphone is supported, and when
connected it enables a new lag test. This test can be
used to measure display lag if both video and audio
follow the same chain.

It uses #YFast Fourier Transform#Y (FFT) to detect the
audio delay by playing a 1Khz tone and accurately
calculating the frame delay.

The #YPurupuru#Y and #YVMU#Y are also supported for some
tests and information display.

All devices can be hotswapped.

The 240p suite is also available in other systems,
including: #YSega Genesis#Y/#YMega Drive#Y, #YSega CD#Y/
#YMega CD#Y, #YNintendo GameCube#Y, #YNintendo Wii#Y and
#YSega Dreamcast#Y.
