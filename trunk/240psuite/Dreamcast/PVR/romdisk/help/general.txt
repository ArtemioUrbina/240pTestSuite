                    HELP

The 240p Test Suite was designed with two goals
in mind:

1) Evaluate 240p signal processing on modern TV
sets and video processing equipment; and 

2) Provide calibration patterns generated on your
game console to help in properly calibrating the
display's black, white and color levels.

Help is availabe on each pattern by pressing the
START button.
