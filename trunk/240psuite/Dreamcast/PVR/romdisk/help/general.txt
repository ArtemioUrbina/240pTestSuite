The 240p Test Suite was designed with two goals
in mind:

1) Evaluate 240p signal processing on modern TV
sets and video processing equipment; and 

2) Provide calibration patterns generated on your
game console to help in properly calibrating the
display's black, white and color levels.

Help is available everywhere by pressing the
Start button. Use right and left in the d-pad to
navigate between help pages.

The Dreamcast microphone is supported, and when
connected it enables a new lag test.

This test can be used to measure display lag if
both video and audio follow the same chain.

It uses fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to detect the
audio delay by playing a 1Khz tone and accurately
calculating the frame delay.

The Purupuru and VMU are also supported for some
tests and information display.

All devices can be hotswapped.
