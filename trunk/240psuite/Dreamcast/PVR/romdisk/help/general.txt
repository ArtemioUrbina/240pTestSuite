The 240p Test Suite was designed with two goals
in mind:

1) Evaluate 240p signal processing on modern TV
sets and video processing equipment; and 

2) Provide calibration patterns generated on your
game console to help in properly calibrating the
display's black, white and color levels.

Help is available everywhere by pressing the
#GStart#G button. Use right and left in the d-pad to
navigate between help pages.

The #YDreamcast#Y microphone is supported, and when
connected it enables a new lag test.

This test can be used to measure display lag if
both video and audio follow the same chain.

It uses #YFast Fourier Transform#Y (FFT) to detect the
audio delay by playing a 1Khz tone and accurately
calculating the frame delay.

The #YPurupuru#Y and #YVMU#Y are also supported for some
tests and information display.

All devices can be hotswapped.         #C(cont...)#C
