              STRIPED SPRITE TEST

There actually are deinterlacers out there which
can display the drop shadows correctly and still
interpreted 240p as 480i. With a striped sprite it
should be easy to tell if a processor tries to
deinterlace (plus interpolate) or not.

The user can change background with the #GA#G button.
Holding the #GY#G button allows to move 1 pixel at
a time.
