    NTSC #GDC#G output a corrupt PAL signal.

#GEnable PAL Background:#G Since most of the menus
    and screens are designed for 240p, this fills
    the borders with the selected color, however
    there are specific PAL patterns that do not 
    need this, such as grids and overscan.

#GChange PAL Background:#G Select the fill color for
    the PAL background.

#GPAL starting line:#G PAL specifies the start of
    active video at line 23 (Top), this setting
    allows centering the active video lines in the
    signal or moving it to the bottom. This allows
    using the suite to calibrate and check overscan
    even if the #GDC#G cannot output the full PAL
    resolution.
                
#G480p Scanline Intensity:#G When in line doubled
    480p mode, the suite allows the display of
    rendered scanlines. This determines the alpha
    value for them, 0% eliminates them.

    VMU. They are auto loaded at start if a save
    is found. Save requires 2 free blocks.
