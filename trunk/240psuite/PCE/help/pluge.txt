                   PLUGE (1/2)


The picture line-up generation equipment (PLUGE)
is a test pattern used to adjust the black level
and contrast of a video signal.

The pattern in this suite is mainly designed to
adjust the black level. The control for setting
this on your TV is usually named Brightness.

This adjustment ensures that anything intended
to be displayed is actually shown, and allows all
detail to be seen on dark scenes.

Button I changes the inner bars between the
lowest B,G,R values and gray. You should use the
blue one in order not to crush detail.


                   PLUGE (2/2)


Reduce the Brightness until the inner bars
are no longer visible, and then slowly raise it
until they are just visible, and go back one
notch where they blend with the background.

Please keep in mind that black levels are lower
in other game consoles, the are just the lowest
values available in this system.
