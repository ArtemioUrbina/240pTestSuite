              MANUAL LAG TEST (1/2)

The main intention is to show a changing pattern
on the screen, which can be complemented with
audio and vibration on the controller if set.
This should show to some degree any lag when
processing the signal.

As an added feature, the user can click the $A
button when the sprite is aligned with the one on
the background, and the offset in frames from the
actual intersection will be shown on screen. This
can be repeated ten times and the software will
calculate the average. Whenever the button was
pressed before the actual intersection frame, the
result will be ignored (but still shown on screen).
SELECT can be used to change the direction
of the sprite from vertical to horizontal, or
display both at the same time.

              MANUAL LAG TEST (2/2)

Of course the evaluation is dependent on reflexes
and/or rhythm more than anything. The visual and
audio cues are the more revealing aspects which
the user should consider, of course the interactive
factor can give an experienced player the hang of
the system when testing via different connections.

Since a frame is around 16 ms (1000/60) in NTSC
that value must be considered the general error
when using the test results.
