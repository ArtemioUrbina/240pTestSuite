                LINEARITY 256


This pattern shows 5 circles, that are matched
to the 10:11 NTSC, but using the 256 horizontal
resolution.

The linearity of the display or upscaler can be 
verified by measuring the diameter of the circles.
Of course the linearity should be kept in all
directions, no distortion should be present.
