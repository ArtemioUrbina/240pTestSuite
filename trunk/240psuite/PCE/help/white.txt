                  WHITE SCREEN

This pattern can be changed between white, black,
red, green, blue and custom color full screens by 
using button I.

Pressing Select while displaying the white screen
will enter color edit mode, to select the RGB
color to fill the screen with.

Some displays and scalers have issues when
changing between a black 0 IRE and a white screen.

This pattern can also be used to check color 
purity, and for dead pixels in some displays.
