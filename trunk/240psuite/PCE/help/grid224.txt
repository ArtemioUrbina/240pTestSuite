                    GRID 224p

This grid uses a 320x224 pattern in a 224p signal.
This vertical resolution is also used by other
consoles, such as the SNES, Sega Genesis and
Playstation.

You can use it to verify that all the visible area
is being displayed, and that there is no distortion
present. Consumer TVs may not show the red squares.

You can press button I to fill all the video signal
background area.
