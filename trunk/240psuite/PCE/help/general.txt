                    HELP (1/2)

The 240p Test Suite was designed with two goals
in mind:

1) Evaluate 240p signal processing on modern TV
sets and video processing equipment; and 

2) Provide calibration patterns generated on your
game console to help in properly calibrating the
display's black, white and color levels.

Help is available everywhere by pressing RUN.
Use right and left in the d-pad to navigate between
help pages. Options can be changed via SELECT
when in the main menus.

The PC Engine version of the suite is
320x240 by default, but can be changed to 320x224p.
Grids and other screens are also available in 
                    HELP (2/2)

256x224, 256x240, 512x224 and 512x240 resolutions.
When in 240p mode the system can start drawing
from video line 22, which is the default of this
suite in order to display all 240 lines.

However all games start from line 24 when in 240p
mode, showing only 239 visible lines. You can
select that mode from the options menu in order to
display the regular signal you'll encounter when
using this console.

The 240p suite is also available in other systems,
including: Sega Genesis/Mega Drive, Sega CD/
Mega CD, Super Nintendo, Nintendo GameCube,
Nintendo Wii and Sega Dreamcast.
