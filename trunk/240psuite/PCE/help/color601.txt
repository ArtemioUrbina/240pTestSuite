            COLOR BARS WITH GRAY SCALE

This pattern idea and layout borrows from the
Digital Video Essentials color adjust pattern.

It has a gray background as reference, and can
be used with color filters in order to adjust
color accuracy. If your display set has a blue
only mode, you can also use that to correct
color balance.
