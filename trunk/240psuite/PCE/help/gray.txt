                    GRAY RAMP 

This gray ramp pattern can be used to check color
balance and to adjust the white level. 

You should make sure the bars are gray, with no
red or blue bias. This can be adjusted with the
individual color settings, or the tint control
in NTSC displays.

In order to adjust white level, you need to use
the contrast control of your TV set. Raise the
contrast to the point where the white bars on the
sides are undistinguishable from each other, and 
then lower it to the point where you can clearly
identify both.
