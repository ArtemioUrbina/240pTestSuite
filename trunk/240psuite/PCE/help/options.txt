#GVI Trap Filter (Composite):#G A Trap filter is
    generally used to improve #YLuma#Y/#YChroma#Y
    separation in the #Ycomposite#Y video signal. When
    disabled, the video signal is unfiltered,
    which sometimes produces visual artefacts such
    as color bleeding. A notch filter centered at
    the color subcarrier frequency is used to 
    extract color from 2.5MHz to 4.5MHz.This method
    has two drawbacks. First, it limits the color
    bandwidth (which extends to 2.1MHz) cutting out
    fine color detail. Second, luminance info in
    the notch frequency range contaminates color
    and generates unwanted color or rainbows.

#GGX Deflickering Filter:#G A filter that removes
    ficker in interlaced modes by softening the
    rendered image.
