Vertical resolution: This system can display either
240p or 224 video. Although the system is capable of
displaying all the 240 vertical lines, games tend to
use only 239 active lines for unkown reasons.

The suite uses the full 240 mode by default, but you
can enable the one games use by selecting to start at
line 24 instead of 22. This will clip the last line
in patterns, but show the real area used by games.

Composite Filter: When in this mode, the system
outputs an extra video line, and uses filtering to
enhance the composite video signal. This extra line
is a result of the filer, and not a complement to the
239 visible lines. (signal ends at line 262)

Composite B&W: This option works only in composite.
It disables the NTSC color burst, eliminating color.
