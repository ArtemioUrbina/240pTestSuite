                     100 IRE

An IRE is a unit used in the measurement of
composite video signals. Its name is derived from
the initials of the Institute of Radio Engineers.

A value of 100 IRE was originally defined to be
the range from black to white in a video signal.

A value of 0 IRE corresponds to the zero voltage
value during the blanking period. The sync pulse
is normally 40 IRE below the zero value, so, peak
to peak, an all white signal should be equal to
140 IRE.

You can press left and right to advance in IRE
steps in the selected range.

Button I toggles the range between [0-100] and
[100-140] IRE.
