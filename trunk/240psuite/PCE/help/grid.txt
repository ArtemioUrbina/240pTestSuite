                       GRID

These grid tests change horizontal resolution
between 256, 320 and 512. You can also vary the
vertical resolution from the options menu. The
pattern should fill all of the 4:3 screen area.

You can use it to verify that all the visible area
is being displayed, and that there is no distortion
present. Consumer TVs may not show the red squares.

The Grids are not perfectly centered within the
NTSC signal, and that is normal. It is the way
Hudson uses each resolution.

You can press button I to fill all the video signal
background area.
