                       GRID

This grid uses a 320x240 pattern, and should fill
all of the 4:3 visible area.

You can use it to verify that all the visible area
is being displayed, and that there is no distortion
present. Consumer TVs may not show the red squares.

The 240 test suite draws from line 22 onwards from
the blanking interval of NTSC signals

You can press button I to fill all the video signal
background area.
