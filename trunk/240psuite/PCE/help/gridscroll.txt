                 GRID SCROLL TEST

A grid is scrolled vertically or horizontally,
which can be used to test linearity of the signal
and how well the display or video processor copes
with scrolling and framerate.

Select can be used to toggle between horizontal
and vertical, while the d-pad up or down
regulates speed. Button I stops the scroll and
d-pad left or right changes direction.
