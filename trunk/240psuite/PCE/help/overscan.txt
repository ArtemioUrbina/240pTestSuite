                     OVERSCAN

With this pattern you can interactively find out
the overscan in pixels and percentage of each
edge in a display.

Increment the overscan with left and right until
you see the white border, then go back one pixel.
The resulting number is the amount of overscan
in pixels in each direction.

This pattern follows the current video options.
